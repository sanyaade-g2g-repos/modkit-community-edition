### Modkit is a web based Visual Programming Environment ###

> In order to communicate with the microcontroller (IE compile and flash a new program) an executible program may be required in addition to the web browser.  This project provides such an executible and is based on the popular Arduino IDE (arduino.cc)..  The main difference between the Arduino IDE and the Modkit Community Edition Compiler is that the Modkit Compiler is meant to work in the background as the user's main interaction is with the Modkit Editor running in a web browser.

> For this reason, the Modkit Compiler opens without the text window showing and is customized to compile and flash programs sent from the Modkit Editor (browser) without any additional user intervention..
